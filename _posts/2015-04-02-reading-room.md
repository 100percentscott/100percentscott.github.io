1. [How to Start a Startup (Sam Altman)](http://startupclass.samaltman.com)
 ——  “CS183B is a class we taught at Stanford. It’s a sort of one-class business course for people who want to start startups. Videos of the lectures, associated reading materials, and assignments are all available here. There are 20 videos, some with a speaker or two and some with a small panel. It’ll be 1,000 minutes of content if you watch it all. We cover how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more. You can’t teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I think we were able to teach a surprising amount. We’ve tried to take some of the best speakers from the past 9 years of Y Combinator dinners and arrange them in a way that will hopefully make sense. We did this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone. It is hopefully valuable even for people who don’t want to start startups. Talks like these have really helped Y Combinator founders create their companies.”

2. [MBA Mondays (Fred Wilson)](http://avc.com/archive/#mba_mondays_archive)  ——  “Every monday I’ll write a post that is about a topic I learned in business school. I’ll keep it dead simple (many people thought my ROI post last week was too simple). And I’ll try to connect it to some real world experience.”
