<br/>
Thinking through the possible outcomes of the Brexit negotiations, and inspired by [this spatial model](https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/spatial-politics-and-brexit-negotiations-fc078bb709e7#.bz6e3hmb3), here’s my take:
The setup follows the article linked above:
>“I’m going to posit two dimensions to the negotiations: a freedom of movement dimension, and a single market access dimension.
The poles of these dimensions are relatively clear:
at one end of the freedom of movement dimension, you have current levels of freedom of movement; at the other end, you have no greater freedom of movement than that which exists between the UK and other third countries
at one end of the single market access dimension, you have current levels of access; at the other end, you have the panoply of tariff-and non-tariff barriers found in the WTO option.”


<br/>
First, looking at the position for the UK…

<br/>
**Hard Brexit point**  —-  trade on WTO terms and no freedom of movement.
<br/>
**Soft Brexit point**  —-  the Norway model, full single market access and full freedom of movement.
<br/>
**The UK ideal point**  —-  full single market access and no freedom of movement. This minimises the economic cost of leaving the single market and satisfies calls to limit immigration (arguably respecting the referendum)
<br/>
**The UK indifference curve**  -—  “Points in the space which are equally far from this ideal point are equally (un)palatable to the UK. Points equally far from this ideal point can be joined by an indifference curve. I’ve drawn one such indifference curve in the plot.”

<br/>
For the EU we see…

<br/>
**The EU ideal point**  -—  trade on WTO terms and full freedom of movement. Why? Because Brexit poses an existential threat to the EU, who can send a clear signal by making the cost to the UK severe.
<br/>
**The EU indifference curve**

<br/>
Putting the UK and EU indifference curves together gives us a line of possible solutions…

<br/>
(Keep in mind here, the closer the indifference curve is to the ideal point, the better the solution is. For example, blue curves closer to the bottom right are better for the EU)
<br/>
<br/>
The actual solution will be somewhere on the yellow segment of the possible solution line…
<br/>

<br/>
This is because for solutions outside of the yellow segment, the UK or EU would be better off forcing a hard brexit, or acquiescing to a soft brexit.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that the EU holds the stronger negotiating position…
<br/>

<br/>
…the likely outcome is shown by the yellow dot. This would mean:
- a big reduction in access to the single market, but not to WTO terms
- a milder reduction to freedom of movement, but tighter restrictions nonetheless

So… not great news for the UK. The economic impact is going to be severe, and restrictions to immigration more limited. Less of a “red, white, and blue” Brexit, and more of a black and blue Brexit.
