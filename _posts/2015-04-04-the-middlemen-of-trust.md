[Dark Leviathan](https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-hidden-internet-can-t-be-a-libertarian-paradise) — the Silk Road might have started as a libertarian experiment, but it was doomed to end as a fiefdom run by pirate kings. An interesting read on the role of trust in the marketplace.

>“Tor’s anonymity helps criminals by making it harder for the state to identify and detain them. Yet this has an ironic side-effect: it also makes it harder for them to trust each other, because they typically can’t be sure who their interlocutors are. To make money in hidden markets, you need people to trust you, so that they will buy from you and sell to you. Having accomplished this first manoeuvre, the truly successful entrepreneurs go one step further. They become middlemen of trust, guaranteeing relations between others and taking a cut from the proceeds.”
