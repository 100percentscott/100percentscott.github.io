Over the last four decades there has been a surge in inequality within many of the world’s most advanced economies. Inequality between individuals, whether wealth or wages, has increased dramatically. Despite having become more productive, many workers have experienced surprisingly poor wage growth. In the United States, for instance, the median worker earned no more in 2009 than they did in 1975, whilst US GDP more than doubled [1]. What drives this distribution problem?
<br/>
<br/>
### **technology**
Over the same period, there have been several important developments that have contributed to this increase in inequality. Globalisation has increased competition between the world’s labour markets, union busting policies have curbed worker’s bargaining powers, and, in the US at least, the real value of the minimum wage has gradually eroded. Most noticeably, however, has been the rise of new technologies — computing, communication and robotics. Economists largely agree that technical change has played a major role in driving inequality.
<br/>
<br/>
As a point of note, technology has a broader definition in economics than in typical use. Technology refers not only to machinery, equipment and techniques, but also to the organisation of production and workers (management technology), and more. Technical change refers to the process of developing, improving and using these new technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
Technology has been singled out by economists for a simple reason. In advanced economies, such as the US, the workforce has become increasingly more educated over the past 60 years. In fact, this trend accelerated after the 1970s (but has since slowed down). All else equal, one would expect a large increase in the supply of educated workers to reduce the returns to education in the labour market. The skill-premium, a measure of the returns to education, in fact rose over the same period suggesting that the relative demand for skilled labour grew quicker than it’s supply. Technology is widely considered to be the cause. Technical change is seen to have been skill biased, that is complementary to skills, and it’s impact on inequality stems from this. Low-skilled workers are left behind in the race between education and technology as they are gradually replaced in the workforce by new technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
It may seem coincidental that the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers occurred just as there was a rise in skill-biased technical change. Even more so when you consider that, historically, technical change has not always been skill-biased, but has oftentimes been skill-replacing. One argument put forward by economists, such as MIT’s Daron Acemoglu, is that technology became increasingly skill biased in response to the increase in supply of skilled workers. Along with more and more skilled workers came greater profit opportunities for skill-complementing technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
A more nuanced view of the impact of technology on inequality has also emerged. As Moore’s law — that computer chip performance doubles roughly every two years — has continued to hold true, technology has become increasingly complex. Rather than performing only low-skilled tasks, new technologies have also been able to perform routine skilled tasks; just think of the computer algorithms that have replaced stock traders, lawyers and paralegals. At the same time, certain low-skilled tasks have been unaffected by technology — we have yet to see a robo-plumber for instance (though robo-chauffeurs have arrived!). The result has been a polarisation of the labour market — routine jobs have been lost to new technologies leaving behind lovely high-skill and lousy low-skill jobs.

### **the 1%**
Differences in education (and the interaction with technology) do not account for all of the changes in inequality that have occurred. Recent research has shed light on the growth in inequality between similarly educated workers at the top of the earnings distribution. The now infamous 1% and the Occupy rallies seen across the world are a testament to the levels of inequality that we now see. The top 1% of Americans, for instance, now take home nearly a quarter of national income, up from 12 percent 25 years ago. Several factors help to explain how these select few have done so much better than the rest, and perhaps several more still remain unknown.
<br/>
<br/>
Briefly, tax policy changes have disproportionately benefited top earners since the 1970s, particularly in the US, which has reduced taxes on top incomes to historically low rates. New technologies have allowed CEO’s and entertainers, for example, to connect with larger audiences, and the size of their pay packets have grown to reflect this. New technologies have also allowed companies to operate with significantly fewer workers, just look at Apple, Google or Facebook. There has also been a surge in high salaries earned in the financial sector, where regulations have been gradually weakened. Lastly, social norms regarding pay, which have been shown to be a restraint on CEO pay, have changed over time, becoming more sympathetic to high salaries (though perhaps this has now changed).

### **family**
Most people, however, do not live alone but with others with whom their social and economic lives are inextricably linked. These economic units can be narrowly defined as families, or more broadly as households. Like earnings inequality between individuals, inequality between households has risen in a number of the world’s advanced economies over the past three decades. The same factors that drive individual inequality affect the level of inequality between households. However, new factors also come into play. For instance, changes in the types of individuals that join together to form households can affect the distribution of earnings between households. This is in fact what has happened with married households where people have increasingly married a partner with a similar level of education. Where a manager may have married their secretary in the past, they are now more likely to marry a co-worker or someone they met at university. Though much smaller in magnitude than the effect of individual inequality, there is evidence that this has impacted household inequality.
<br/>
<br/>
No discussion of family inequality can ignore the rise of women in the labour market. The rise in female labour force participation is one of the most important developments in 20th century labour markets. Women are increasingly playing the role of the breadwinner in the family, married women now bring in slightly over a third of household earnings in the US and UK, up from 20% 30 years ago. Looking forward, women are set to play an increasingly important role particularly as many of the job categories projected to grow in the future, such as teaching and healthcare, are traditionally dominated by women. These changes will likely impact household inequality.
