[China’s Money Exodus](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-11-02/china-s-money-exodus)
>“The ranks of China’s wealthy continue to surge. As their economy shows signs of weakness at home, they’re sending money overseas at unprecedented levels to seek safer investments… In total, UBS Group estimated that $324 billion moved out last year. While this year’s numbers aren’t yet in, during the three weeks in August after China devalued its currency, Goldman Sachs calculated that another $200 billion may have left… So how do these volumes of cash get out when Chinese are limited by rules that allow them to convert only $50,000 per person a year?”
