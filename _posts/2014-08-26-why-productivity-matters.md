title:  why productivity matters

Productivity growth  ——  the rise in the amount we produce from each unit of input  ——  is important. As we get better at producing the goods we consume, we waste less and free up resources. All else equal, goods get cheaper and we employ fewer workers to produce them. These changes have important consequences for consumers, workers and the environment.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many factors that determine how productive we are. Most directly, technological advances, rising skill levels and increasing efficiency allow us to find new and better ways of production. Regulatory, legal and cultural factors too affect how we organise and produce our goods. Competition, however, underpins much of the process. Competitive pressures force less productive firms to improve, if not, they are eventually driven out of the market by more productive firms.
<br/>
<br/>
There remains, however, a large variation in productivity across firms and countries. Despite the increasing ease with which information & technology spreads and the increasingly competitive nature of global markets, when given a similar set of inputs some firms produce significantly more than others. Why is this?
<br/>
<br/>
### **management**
One answer may be management. Better managed firms use inputs more efficiently, minimising waste and other production costs. And, like productivity, there is a wide variation in management quality across firms.
<br/>
<br/>
Academic economists have typically been skeptical of the role of management. They argue that firms are driven to minimise costs in a competitive market. Any differences, then, in management practices between firms simply reflect each firm’s best response to their specific conditions. A growing body of research, however, points to a strong link between management and productivity.
<br/>
<br/>
A large management practices project involving Cambridge, Harvard, the LSE, McKinsey & Company and Stanford has developed a basic management practice evaluation toolkit, and evaluated over 10,000 organisations across twenty countries (worldmanagementsurvey.org). The project scored each organisation’s management according to a specific set of basic practices, including key lean manufacturing principles such as performance monitoring, target setting, and certain human resource management practices. These scores were combined into a single metric reflecting each organisation’s overall quality of management.
<br/>
<br/>
The researchers produced an internationally comparable management dataset which confirmed that there exists a wide variation in management quality across organisations. Moreover, they were able to show a strong positive correlation between an organisation’s management score and their productivity.
<br/>
<br/>
Using this same diagnostic tool, researchers at Stanford University ran a randomised controlled trial on several large Indian textile firms (Bloom et. al 2012). In short, the researchers allocated each firm that participated in the experiment to either a treatment or control group. Firms in the treatment group received several months of professional consulting and firms in the control group did not. As a result, the management scores, productivity and profits of the treatment group firms rose significantly relative to the control group. These findings show a causal link between the management practices of an organisation and their level of productivity and profits.
<br/>
<br/>
### **market failures**
Given the large positive impact of improving basic management practices, why do less productive firms not make those changes? After all, the math is simple, making the changes makes economic sense. Looking at manufacturing, one possible reason may be informational constraints: firms in the Indian experiment were oftentimes unaware that they were badly managed. Moreover, firm owners often did not believe adopting common practices would improve their performance.
<br/>
<br/>
If poorly managed less productive firms are often reluctant to improve their management practices, why does competition not drive them from the market? One cause is where competitive pressures are being restricted. Government policy, such as tariffs, and market failures, such as the lack of access to finance, have a direct impact on competition and no doubt play a role. The Indian experiment also points to the insidious effects ineffective institutions have on competition. A weak legal system led Indian firm owners to typically trust only close male family members with senior management duties. As a result, a firm’s size was usually constrained by the number of men closely related to the owner.
