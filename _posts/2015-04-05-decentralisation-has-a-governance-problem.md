>“What is more interesting to me is that this XT fork showcases a number of interesting things about open source software and how it is governed… Bitcoin is a democracy in more ways than its core developer group. The miners who operate the transactional infrastructure of bitcoin are also a democracy. They decide what software they want to run to mine bitcoin. And in doing so, they determine what technology will become the standard… Of course, miners are not necessarily a representative sample of the entire bitcoin ecosystem. They have particular needs, desires, and are at times ruthless and mercenary. But they are the ones who operate the bitcoin transactional infrastructure and they will ultimately decide if the Bitcoin XT fork works or not… It will be fascinating to watch this play out. If you are used to big corporations or governmental institutions making decisions behind closed doors about how your financial systems work, then you might enjoy watching a new model of innovation and technology evolution unfold. I believe we will see more and more things like this in the coming years.”

-----------------------
**Update**: I continue to see governance as one of the bigger challenges to decentralisation. Tezos is a noteworthy project that attempts to address this problem. It is sad, however, to see how poorly they approach their own governance as a company, given their mission to enable decentralised governance

[Tezos](https://www.tezos.com/governance)
>"While all blockchains offer financial incentives for maintaining consensus on their ledgers, no blockchain has a robust on-chain mechanism that seamlessly amends the rules governing its protocol and rewards protocol development. As a result, first-generation blockchains empower de facto, centralized core development teams or miners to formulate design choices.
<br/>
<br/>
Tezos takes a fundamentally different approach by creating governance rules for stakeholders to approve of protocol upgrades that are then automatically deployed on the network. When a developer proposes a protocol upgrade, they can attach an invoice to be paid out to their address upon approval and inclusion of their upgrade. This approach provides a strong incentive for participation in the Tezos core development and further decentralizes the maintenance of the network. It compensates developers with tokens that have immediate value rather than forcing them to seek corporate sponsorships, foundation salaries, or work for Internet fame alone."

<br/>
The Tezos ICO raised $230m dollars. The founders will receive 8.5% of the contributions made during the fundraiser upfront, in addition to 10% of the tokens. The rest of the funds will be disbursed by the Tezos Foundation - a Swiss foundation based in Zug run by its 3 directors - with full/limited/no? oversight from contributors.
<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to see how the decision taken by the founders to receive a slice of the contributions upfront would be controversial. They clearly believe they are entitled to do so. What is interesting to me, however, is how such governance issues are central to not just how changes are made to networks, but to how those networks are launched and funded. Tezos appears to have addressed one governance issue with technology, and the other with at most a [snarky statement](https://www.tezos.com/dls):

>The terms [] balance risk and reward in a manner consistent with a real product which we developed before asking any contribution. A vocal minority of the cryptocurrency community have strong feelings regarding the type of agreements they deem acceptable when launching networks, and equally intricate models that they use to justify their position. The Ethereum fundraiser, which helped Ethereum blossom into a successful project with a vibrant community, was decried as “unconscionable” by many a keyboard warrior. Tezos’ founders do not share this vocal minority’s ethos, nor do we ask that those who embrace it take part of in the Tezos fundraiser. We suggest instead that they find, and contribute to, a project which does share their values. If you think our project is cool, has merit, and elegantly solves an important problem using solid technology, we hope you'll contribute.
