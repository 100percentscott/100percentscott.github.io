>“Moore’s law is silicon valley’s guiding principle, like all ten commandments wrapped up in one. The law states that chips get better at an accelerating rate. They don’t just accumulate improvements, in the way that a pile of rocks gets higher when you add more rocks. Instead of being added, the improvements multiply. The technology seems to always get twice as good every two years. No-one knows how long this can continue. We don’t agree on exactly why Moore’s Law or other similar patterns exist. Is it a human driven, self-fulfilling prophecy or an intrinsic, inevitable quality of technology?”

>“[It takes] huge amounts to build the fab plants, and yet more…to pay for the design teams to design new chips. Intel makes these investments, which are in the [billions of dollars], because they expect to reap way more [billions of dollars] in profits in the following years. But if there is doubt that those profits will arrive, and possibly if they just doubt they can come up with the necessary silicon improvements, they may not want to make the investment at all. Should a major player like Intel make such a call, that would effectively end Moore’s Law all by itself, because then the various companies that make the super expensive tools for chip production will themselves not make the investments needed to keep Moore’s Law alive.”
